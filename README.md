## Intro 👋
- Born & raised in rural Massachusetts
- Former theater kid
- Actually started undergrad in Fire Protection Engineering because it seemed like a safe career path during the ‘08 Recession — but ended up double majoring in Film & Journalism 🤷‍♂️
- Bounced around the USA in my 20s, spending time in NY, MA, Portland, & Los Angeles before landing in Seattle
- Outside of work, I’m often playing D&D, learning guitar, rock climbing, paddle boarding, hiking, or volunteering on trails


## Environment & Communication 🎧 🌐
- I’m usually in the Bellevue office Mondays & Tuesdays and the occassional Thursday.
- **Meeting Availability:** I prefer 8:30a-4p PST for meetings, but I am more than happy to meet later/earlier as long as I have 24hr notice
- **Action Items:** If we’re in a meeting and an action item comes up — lets try to deal with it or open an issue in real time
- **Zoom:** Zoom (or face-to-face) is the best way to have a conversation with me
- **Slack:** Slack messages are the second best and preferred for quick questions or async chats
- **Email:** Email is somewhere far down the list, probably after smoke signals

## Communication Quirks 🙋‍♂️
- Sometimes I jump to question-asking mode without considering it might not be what you need from the conversation. If it’s clear I’ve misread, PLEASE interrupt and redirect me. I don't want to have wasted your time
- Sometimes when I’m presented with a lot of new ideas or information all at once, I get very quiet and I am slow to take initiative. I’m present and I care, I'm just processing and digesting
- I’m overly-cautious about celebrating major milestones or accomplishments before they’re official/shipped/signed or otherwise un-takeback-able
- I LOVE virtual whiteboards


## Support 👨‍💻
- Talk to me about career stuff! As someone who has already has a few serious career pivots under their belt, I really enjoy thinking about how to find work that’s valuable and interesting
- I’m always more than happy to chat about SEO, content, wordsmithing, brainstorming, leadership, public speaking, data visualization, and data storytelling
- In what appears to be a theme for the team — I’m also very passionate about mental health and am always happy to talk openly about managing depression, anxiety, panic attacks, burnout, and insomnia

## Peeves 👎
- Drivers who don’t use their turn signals (bonus hatred if they weave in traffic)
- The phrase “it is what it is” — 99% of the time it ‘is’ what someone else made 'it'. Hold people accountable
- Notifications
- Overuse of the word "that" in online writing
- Whenever someone insists everyone needs a personal brand
- Any time someone says they don’t want to adopt a pet from a shelter because “you just don't know what you’re going to get” 
- Lawns
- Golf

## Faves 👍
- Biking along the canal on a warm summer night with no one else around, passing by quiet docks and sleeping storage facilities
- The podcasts ‘[Ologies](https://www.alieward.com/ologies)’, ‘[The 538 Politics Podcast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/)’, and ‘[The Anthropocene Reviewed](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed)’
- Going through the full 360 of a revolving door before exiting
- Introducing people to D&D for the first time
- Drive-in movie theaters
- Em dashes (these things —)
- Old dusty cats in old dusty bookstores
